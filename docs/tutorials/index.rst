To view a static version of the notebooks online, you can use the following link: `<https://nbviewer.org/github/watertap-org/watertap/blob/main/tutorials/00-index.ipynb>?flush_cache=true`_.

Running the notebooks
---------------------

.. note::
    For important details on running tutorial notebooks, refer to :ref:`this guide<notebooks>`.

**To run WaterTAP tutorials online (no installation required), click on the "launch binder" button below to launch an environment pointing to the current** ``main`` **branch of the WaterTAP repository:**

.. warning::
    **The use of Binder is currently an experimental effort for WaterTAP. Binder may take a long time to launch completely or may not launch successfully at all in some cases. If this happens, please follow the link to tutorials that was provided above.**

Additional resources
--------------------

Since WaterTAP is based on the IDAES platform and follows its conventions,
the `IDAES tutorials <https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/tutorials_examples.html>`_ are a good starting point for learning how to use WaterTAP.

In particular, new users should be familiar with Python and Pyomo. Because WaterTAP
and IDAES share this common base, we refer users unfamiliar with Python or Pyomo to
the IDAES tutorials `Short introduction to Python and Pyomo <https://idaes.github.io/examples-pse/latest/Tutorials/Basics/introduction_short_solution_doc.html>`_ or the 
`Longer introduction to Python and Pyomo <https://idaes.github.io/examples-pse/latest/Tutorials/Basics/introduction_solution_doc.html>`_.
