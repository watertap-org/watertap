Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)
===============================
This is an empirical, performance-based granular activated carbon (GAC) model that works under the following criteria and assumptions:
   * simulation of this unit model is only supported with the Multi-Component Aqueous Solution (MCAS) property package
   * supports a single liquid phase only
   * supports adsorption of a single solute species only while other species are considered inert
   * supports steady-state only
   * assumes isothermal conditions
   * model performance is independent of a gravity-fed or pressurized GAC unit, therefore assumes isobaric conditions

Introduction
------------
The implemented model for estimating GAC performance is adapted from a simplified model originally presented in Hand, 1984 and
further elaborated in Crittenden, 2012. This formulation is denoted as the constant-pattern homogeneous surface diffusion model (CPHSDM).
As a GAC system is operated as a batch process, a mass transfer zone (MTZ) is formed in the bed where a concentration profile, or
breakthrough curve, develops as a function of the adsorption properties. This MTZ is bounded by saturated GAC upstream and
fresh GAC downstream. The CPHSDM is valid under the assumption that the shape of the MTZ is constant as it travels through the
bed and a constant pattern solution (CPS) may be determined. The CPS is calculated through a multistep procedure utilizing common
dimensionless groups applied in polynomial fits to determine performance. Therefore, coefficients used in the polynomial must be
derived from experimental data of the intended system to produce valid results. Coefficients for common compounds treated by GAC may be
found in both Hand, 1984 and Crittenden, 2012. The model is estimated to have within 10% error and therefore may be applied to bed lengths
shorter than the minimum length determined by the CPHSDM within the error threshold (in addition to being applicable to bed lengths greater than the minimum length determined by the CPHSDM).

The batch operation results of the CPS are converted to approximate steady-state results for intuitive use of the model
for flowsheet purposes. A visualization of the transformation is provided in Figure 1. For a traditional breakthrough
curve the CPHSDM method calculates the single point, single ``conc_ratio_replace`` and ``operational_time``, highlighted on the
breakthrough curve. This operational time is the amount of elapsed time after startup that the bed is refreshed with new
GAC adsorbent. Steady state concentration can be analogous to all of the effluent in this operational time being stored
as holdup, therefore the average concentration ratio is significantly less than concentration ratio at the time of
bed replacement, as many days pass before the start of the breakthrough. To approximate the average effluent
concentration in this time frame, the breakthrough curve is numerically integrated with the trapezoid rule. The curve is
discretized with respect to the concentration ratio instead of the (traditionally done 'x' variable) operational time
due to simplicity of solving the model equations.

    Figure 1. Discretization of the breakthrough curve for the steady state approximation. The ratio of the shaded area
    to the area left of the vertical dotted line corresponding to ``operational_time`` is the calculated
    ``conc_ratio_avg``. Expected values of ``conc_ratio_avg`` are often less than 0.25 depending on the
    ``conc_ratio_replace`` setpoint.

Degrees of Freedom
------------------
In the default configuration of the GAC unit model there are 17 degrees of freedom in addition to the inlet state variables
(i.e., temperature, pressure, component flowrates) that should be fixed for the model to be fully specified.
In association with using the Freundlich adsorption isotherm and empirical model, the following 9 variables are almost always fixed
and may be derived from experimental data:

   * Freundlich isotherm :math:`k` parameter
   * Freundlich isotherm :math:`\frac{1}{n}` parameter
   * Stanton number equation parameters :math:`a_0` and :math:`a_1` (Hand, 1984), (Crittenden, 1987)
   * throughput ratio equation parameters :math:`b_0`, :math:`b_1`, :math:`b_2`, :math:`b_3` and :math:`b_4` (Hand, 1984)

Additionally, the following 9 variables are traditionally fixed:

   * particle apparent density
   * particle diameter
   * empty bed contact time
   * bed voidage *or* particle bulk density
   * superficial velocity *or* bed length
   * effluent to inlet concentration ratio at operational time *or* steady state approximation of average effluent to inlet concentration ratio in operational time by trapezoid rule *or* bed volumes treated
   * surface diffusion coefficient
   * liquid phase film transfer coefficient

When setting the configuration options to calculate the surface diffusion coefficient and liquid phase film transfer coefficient,
these respective variables are no longer specified and 4 newly introduced variables must be fixed. This excludes new variables
or parameters that may be required to be specified within the property package when called by the GAC model. This is a net result of 19 degrees of freedom.
Newly utilized variables that must be fixed include:

   * shape correction factor
   * particle porosity
   * tortuosity of the path that the adsorbate must take as compared to the radius
   * surface-to-pore diffusion flux ratio

Model Structure
------------------
The GAC model consists of 1 ControlVolume0DBlock (process_flow) for the process flow of the water treatment train.
The process flow includes 2 StateBlocks (inlet and outlet) which are used for mass and momentum balances.
It also includes 1 StateBlock (adsorbed) for the solute that is adsorbed into the GAC particles.
The material removed in the adsorbed state block is simulated as liquid phase solute but should be interpreted as solute that has adsorbed
into the solid phase GAC particles. The steady state mass removal and replacement rate of the GAC itself is provided as a unit model
variable and excluded from flowsheet material balances. Therefore, GAC is never included as a component in property package specifications.

Variables
----------
Supporting only a single solute, variables concerning the adsorption of a species are respective to the target species
although not explicitly indexed. All other species are inert from a mass balance perspective, but effects of background
species to the adsorption of the target species may be modeled by adjusting the Freundlich isotherm parameters and other
variables in the model.
