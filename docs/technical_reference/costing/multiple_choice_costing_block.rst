Multiple Choice Unit Model Costing Block
========================================

.. currentmodule:: watertap.costing.multiple_choice_costing_block

The MultiUnitModelCostingBlock class is a wrapper around the IDAES
``UnitModelCostingBlock`` which allows the modeller to easily explore the implications of
different unit model costing choices on overall flowsheet costs without rebuilding
a new flowsheet or replacing Pyomo components.

MultiUnitModelCostingBlock objects instead construct every single costing relationship
specified for the unit model, and controls which one is active through the indexed
mutable parameter ``costing_block_selector``, which takes the value `1` when the
associated costing block is active and the value `0` otherwise. The helper method
``select_costing_block`` handles activating a single costing block whilst deactivating
all other costing blocks.

Usage
-----

The MultiUnitModelCostingBlock allows the user to pre-specify all costing methods
on-the-fly and change between them without rebuilding the flowsheet or even the base
costing relationships on the costing package.

The code below demonstrates its use on a reverse osmosis unit model.
