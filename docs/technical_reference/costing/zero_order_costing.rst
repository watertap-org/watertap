Zero Order Costing Package
==========================

.. currentmodule:: watertap.costing.zero_order_costing

The zero order costing module contains the costing package typically used for zero order models, though it can also be used for high-fidelity models. Technoeconomic data used for zero order models is contained in the
``.yaml`` file for that model located in the data/techno_economic folder. The zero order costing module extends functionality of the :ref:`technical_reference/costing/watertap_costing_detailed:Detailed WaterTAP Costing Package`
to support loading parameters from pre-defined ``.yaml`` files. It has the same technoecnomic factors as the :ref:`technical_reference/costing/watertap_costing_detailed:Detailed WaterTAP Costing Package` but with different
parameter values.


Usage
-----

The ZeroOrderCosting class contains all the variables and constraints needed to cost a unit model derived from the :ref:`ZeroOrderBaseData`. It also inherits the functionality of the :ref:`WaterTAPCostingBlockData`.

The code below shows an outline of how the ZeroOrderCostingData class is intended to be used to cost zero-order type models.

.. code-block::

  from pyomo.environ import ConcreteModel

  from idaes.core import FlowsheetBlock

  from watertap.costing.zero_order_costing import ZeroOrderCosting
  from watertap.core.wt_database import Database
  from watertap.core.zero_order_properties import WaterParameterBlock
  from watertap.unit_models.zero_order import MyZOUnit


  m = ConcreteModel()
  m.db = Database()
  m.fs = FlowsheetBlock(dynamic=False)
  m.fs.params = WaterParameterBlock(solute_list=["comp_a", "comp_b", "comp_c"])
  m.fs.costing = ZeroOrderCosting()
  m.fs.unit = MyZOUnit(property_package=m.fs.params, database=m.db)

  # Add necessary statements to fix component flows prior to solve

Calculations for each of these costs are presented below.

Costing Index and Technoeconomic Factors
----------------------------------------

Costing indices are available in ``default_case_study.yaml`` located in the data/techno_economic folder. 
Costs from year A to year B are adjusted according to:

.. math::

    \text{Cost in B} = \text{Cost in A} \left( \frac{\text{Index at B}}{\text{Index at A}} \right)

WaterTAP uses the `Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index <https://www.toweringskills.com/financial-analysis/cost-indices/>`_ (CEPCI) 
to account for the time-value of investments. Aggregated capital and operating costs are 
adjusted to the desired year for the model, accessible on the costing block as ``base_currency``. 
The default costing year is 2018, but the user can directly set the ``base_currency`` at 
the flowsheet level (e.g., ``m.fs.costing.base_currency = pyo.units.USD_2023``) or via a provided case study ``.yaml``.

Other technoeconomic factors used to calculate various system metrics, capital, and operating costs are presented in the table below:

=============================================  ====================  =====================================  ===============  ==============================================================================


The capital recovery factor is calculated with:

    .. math::

        f_{crf} = \frac{ f_{wacc} (1 + f_{wacc}) ^ L}{ (1 + f_{wacc}) ^ L - 1}


Capital Cost Calculations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

In general, unit process capital costs :math:`C_{ZO,u}` for zero order unit models are a function of flow:

    .. math::

        C_{ZO,u} = A \bigg( \frac{Q_{in}}{Q_{basis}} \bigg) ^ {B}

:math:`Q_{basis}`, :math:`A`, and :math:`B` are specific to the unit model and can be found in the unit model ``.yaml`` file.
The :math:`A` value has units of USD for the costing reference year of the unit. For example, if the unit costing model
is from a reference that used 2015 USD, the units for :math:`A` are ``USD_2015``. After calculating the costs in 2015 USD, WaterTAP
adjusts the cost to the user-specified year via the Consumer Price Index.

The total capital cost of a zero order model :math:`C_{ZO,tot}` includes the land cost :math:`C_{land}` and working
capital costs :math:`C_{work}`:

    .. math::

        C_{ZO,tot} = C_{ZO,u} + C_{land} + C_{work}

Where:

    .. math::

        & C_{land} = f_{land} C_{ZO,u} \\\\
        & C_{work} = f_{work} C_{ZO,u}


Custom Capital Cost Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several zero order models that have costing relationships that do not follow this general form. If that is the case, a custom costing method can
be added to the unit model class to perform that calculation.

Zero order models that have custom capital costing methods include:

* Brine concentrator - ``cost_brine_concentrator()``
* CANDOP - ``cost_CANDOP()``
* Chemical addition - ``cost_chemical_addition()``
* Chlorination - ``cost_chlorination()``
* Coagulation/Flocculation - ``cost_coag_and_floc()``
* Deep well injection - ``cost_deep_well_injection()``
* DMBR - ``cost_dmbr()``
* Electrochemical nutrient removal - ``cost_electrochemical_nutrient_removal()``
* Evaporation pond - ``cost_evaporation_pond()``
* Filter press - ``cost_filter_press()``
* Fixed bed - ``cost_fixed_bed()``
* GAC - ``cost_gac()``
* Landfill - ``cost_landfill()``
* MABR - ``cost_mabr()``
* Ion exchange - ``cost_ion_exchange()``
* Iron/Manganese removal - ``cost_iron_and_manganese_removal()``
* Metab - ``cost_metab()``
* Nanofiltration - ``cost_nanofiltration()``
* Ozone - ``cost_ozonation()``
* Ozone + AOP - ``cost_ozonation_aop()``
* Photothermal membrane - ``cost_photothermal_membrane()``
* Sedimentation - ``cost_sedimentation()``
* Storage tank - ``cost_storage_tank()``
* Surface discharge - ``cost_surface_discharge()``
* UV irradiation - ``cost_uv()``
* UV + AOP - ``cost_uv_aop()``
* Well field - ``cost_well_field()``

To add a custom capital calculation method, the unit model class must register its custom costing method by setting the ``default_costing_method`` attribute.


Operating Cost Calculations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Total operating costs for zero order models :math:`C_{op,tot}` include fixed :math:`C_{op,fix}` and variable operating costs :math:`C_{op,var}`:

    .. math::

        C_{op,tot} = C_{op,fix} + C_{op,var}

The total fixed operating costs are calculated as:

    .. math::

        C_{op,fix} = C_{sal} + C_{ben} + C_{maint} + C_{lab} + C_{ins}

Where:

    .. math::

        & C_{sal} = f_{sal} C_{ZO,u} \\\\
        & C_{ben} = f_{ben} C_{sal} \\\\
        & C_{maint} = f_{maint} C_{ZO,u} \\\\
        & C_{lab} = f_{lab} C_{ZO,u} \\\\
        & C_{ins} = f_{ins} C_{ZO,u}

Variable operating costs include any chemical additions, electricity costs, and other variable costs such as equipment
replacements.

    .. math::

        C_{op,var} = C_{chem} + C_{elec} + C_{other} + C_{op,tot}

Chemical costs are based on the chemical dosage for a given chemical addition. Default chemical costs are found in ``default_case_study.yaml``. The
annual chemical costs are calculated as:

    .. math::

        C_{chem} = \sum_{k}^{n} D_k C_k Q_{in} f_{util}`

Where :math:`D` is the dose of chemical :math:`k` and :math:`C` is the unit cost of chemical :math:`k`.

Electricity costs :math:`C_{elec}` are based on the energy intensity :math:`E` of the unit process
(see individual unit model documentation for details).
The annual electricity costs are calculated as:

    .. math::

        C_{elec} = E Q_{in} f_{util} P

LCOW Calculation
++++++++++++++++

The Levelized Cost Of Water (LCOW) is a metric used to assess the technoeconomics of a unit process:

    .. math::

        LCOW = \frac{ f_{crf} C_{ZO,tot} + C_{op,tot} }{Q f_{util} }

Other aggregates, like specific energy consumption, are provided through the :ref:`WaterTAPCostingBlockData`: :ref:`technical_reference/costing/costing_base:Aggregate Metrics`.
