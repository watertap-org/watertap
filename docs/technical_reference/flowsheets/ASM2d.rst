Activated Sludge Model No. 2d
=============================

Introduction
------------

The Activated Sludge Model No. 2d (ASM2d) represents a variation of the ASM1 model to account for biological phosphorus  with 
nitrification-denitrification. The  :ref:`ASM2d <ASM2d>` property and reaction relationships
of an activated sludge model for biological nutrient removal from wastewater using an activated sludge biological reactor with 
biological phosphorus removal as provided in  `Henze, M. et al. (1999) 
<https://iwaponline.com/wst/article-abstract/39/1/165/4841/Activated-Sludge-Model-No-2d-ASM2D>`_.

Implementation
--------------

Figure 1 shows the process flow diagram for ASM2d, where influent wastewater is fed to a series of activated sludge
reactors and a secondary clarifier (secondary treatment). CSTRs are used to model the two anaerobic tanks and the two anoxic reactors 
in the activated sludge process and CSTRs with injection (which accounts for aeration tanks) are used to model the three aerobic reactors.
Finally, the effluent is passed through a clarifier. Note that a pressure changer is required in the recycle stream to ensure the
pressure inside the recycle loop, is bounded. As the inlet Mixer uses a pressure minimization constraint and there is no pressure 
drop in the reactors, if pressure is not specified at some point within the recycle loop then it becomes unbounded.
The flowsheet relies on the following key assumptions:

   * supports steady-state only
   * property and reaction packages are provided for the activated sludge model (ASM2d)
   * the clarifier is modeled as a separator with split fractions by components

Degrees of Freedom
------------------
The following variables are initially specified for simulating the ASM2d flowsheet (i.e., degrees of freedom = 0):
    * feed water conditions (flow, temperature, pressure, component concentrations, and alkalinity)
    * volume of activated sludge reactors
    * component injection rates for aerobic reactors
    * secondary clarifier split fraction(s)
    * pressure changer outlet pressure (feeds into the activated sludge process)

Future Refinements
------------------

The following modifications to ASM2d are planned for development:
    * Improving costing relationships in terms of detail, completeness, and reasonable validity
    * Accounting for temperature-dependence in the oxygen mass transfer coefficient (KLa) and oxygen concentration at saturation
    * Replacing the ideal-separator formulation in the secondary clarifier with the widely used double-exponential settling model (i.e., the Takacs model)

**NOTE:** The repository also contains flowsheets for ASM2d modified for phosphorous removal, for property and reaction reference:
:ref:`modified ASM2d <modified_ASM2d>`
