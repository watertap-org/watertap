Activated Sludge Model No. 1
============================

Introduction
------------

Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1) was created by the International Water Association (IWA) to create a mathematical model to predict the output of activated sludge 
models. The model aims to incorporate carbon oxidation, nitrification, and denitrification. The model quantifies 
the kinetics and stoichiometry of each process. The :ref:`ASM1 <ASM1>` property and reaction relationships
are based on the relationships for the activated sludge biological reactor provided in `Henze, M. et al. (1987) 
<https://belinra.inrae.fr/doc_num.php?explnum_id=4467>`_.

Implementation
--------------

Figure 1 shows the process flow diagram for ASM1, where influent wastewater is fed to a series of activated sludge
reactors and a secondary clarifier (secondary treatment). CSTRs are used to model the two anoxic reactors in the activated
sludge process and CSTRs with injection (which accounts for aeration tanks) are used to model the three aerobic reactors.
Finally, the effluent is passed through a clarifier. Note that a pressure changer is required in the recycle stream to ensure the
pressure inside the recycle loop, is bounded. As the inlet Mixer uses a pressure minimization constraint and there is no pressure 
drop in the reactors, if pressure is not specified at some point within the recycle loop then it becomes unbounded.
The flowsheet relies on the following key assumptions:

   * supports steady-state only
   * property and reaction packages are provided for the activated sludge model (ASM)
   * the clarifier is modeled as a separator with split fractions by components

Documentation for each of the unit models can be found below. All unit models were set up with their default configuration arguments.

Degrees of Freedom
------------------
The following variables are initially specified for simulating the ASM1 flowsheet (i.e., degrees of freedom = 0):
    * feed water conditions (flow, temperature, pressure, component concentrations, and alkalinity)
    * volume of activated sludge reactors
    * component injection rates for aerobic reactors
    * secondary clarifier split fraction(s)
    * pressure changer outlet pressure (feeds into the activated sludge process)

Future Refinements
------------------

The following modifications to ASM1 are planned for development:
    * Improving costing relationships in terms of detail, completeness, and reasonable validity
    * Accounting for temperature-dependence in the oxygen mass transfer coefficient (KLa) and oxygen concentration at saturation
    * Replacing the ideal-separator formulation in the secondary clarifier with the widely used double-exponential settling model (i.e., the Takacs model)
