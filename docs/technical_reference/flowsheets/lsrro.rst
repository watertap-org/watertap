Introduction
---------------

Low-Salt-Rejection Reverse Osmosis (LSRRO) is an innovative membrane-based desalination technology designed to concentrate high-salinity brines with potentially lower energy consumption and cost compared to traditional thermal processes. 
LSRRO addresses the limitations of conventional reverse osmosis by utilizing low-salt-rejection (LSR) membranes. These membranes allow the passage of water molecules while permitting a controlled amount of salt permeation, which reduces the transmembrane osmotic pressure.
Moreover, LSRRO can be constructed using commercially available nanofiltration modules with low monovalent ion rejection or oxidant-treated reverse osmosis modules, making it more readily deployable.


Implementation
==============

Figure 1 illustrates the LSRRO flowsheet. The LSRRO system comprises a conventional RO stage followed by low-salt-rejection (LSR) stages, where the saline permeate of each LSR stage is recycled to the inlet of the previous stage. Brine is concentrated further as it passes through each subsequent LSR stage.
The first stage RO permeate is collected as purified water (Product Water) and the last LSR stage produces the final concentrated brine. 
Primary pumps are located upstream of each RO or LSR stage. These pumps pressurize the feed to the RO stage and the concentrated brine from the previous stage to the LSR stages.
Booster pumps are used to pressurize the permeate recycled from the subsequent LSR stages. 
Mixers combine the pressurized streams from the primary pumps and booster pumps. The resulting mixed stream is then fed into the next LSR stage.
Energy recovery devices (ERDs) are employed to optimize energy use. These devices recover energy from the retentate stream of the first RO stage and the final brine from the last LSR stage.

The flowsheet relies on the following key assumptions:

   * supports steady-state only
   * supports optimization and minimizes levelized cost of water (LCOW) with constraints
   * `NaCl Property Package <https://watertap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical_reference/property_models/NaCl.html>`_ is utilized
   * number of stages and system recovery should be specified for optimization

   * `RO and LSR <https://watertap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical_reference/unit_models/reverse_osmosis_0D.html>`_
   * `Mixer <https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference_guides/model_libraries/generic/unit_models/mixer.html>`_

Documentation for the property model can be found here:

This flowsheet aims to solve an optimization problem that minimizes the levelized cost of water (LCOW) with a specified number of stages and system mass recovery. LCOW can be represented by the following equation where :math:`Q` represents product volumetric flow, :math:`f_{crf}` represents the capital recovery factor, :math:`C_{cap,tot}` represents the total capital cost, :math:`C_{op,tot}` represents the total operating cost, and :math:`f_{util}` represents the utilization factor:

    .. math::

        LCOW_{Q} = \frac{f_{crf} \cdot C_{cap,tot} + C_{op,tot}}{f_{util} \cdot Q}
   

Additional variables, parameters, and constraints
